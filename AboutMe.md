## Interesting Facts

Aside from being a computer student who holes up and plays skyrim waiting for elder scrolls 7 to be announced, I also have partaken in a some less than ordinary sports. I took fencing lessons for a summer once and got stabbed many times. I tried out downhill mountain biking and had I not run into a tree, I would've flown down the side of a mountain. My father coached my brother and I to be better than average table tennis players. I love racing and had a quick stint of a go karting phase. Possibly the craziest of them all is, choosing to run cross country and enjoying it. 

Also... I own this
